We selected the article "Museum Interface," which discusses how digital interfaces and interactive technologies are transforming visitor experiences in museums. Museums can create personalized and immersive learning experiences by integrating technologies like augmented reality and touch displays. The blue theme was chosen because it is timeless and complements the historic or artistic objects on display. We also chose MuseoModerno and Bayon, which reflect museum, bold, and modern typographic styles. In the conversation, the sticky indicates who is speaking. The multiple rectangles (grid) indicate how most people visit the digital museum rather than the physical one due to convenience.
